# 📚 Educational Automations Portfolio

Automation in the **education sector** can save time, increase accuracy, and improve learning outcomes. Across schools, colleges, and other educational institutions, automated workflows can help:

- Collect assignments and submissions efficiently  
- Grade assignments using AI  
- Provide instant feedback to students  
- Organize and manage student data  
- Streamline administrative tasks  

To demonstrate these possibilities, I created several educational automations using n8n workflows. Each automation is organized in its own subfolder. Click the links below to explore each workflow’s case study, video demo, screenshots, and notes.
