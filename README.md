# samia-n8n-library
This repository showcases n8n-based AI agents and automations designed by Samia Israr.
Instead of providing ready-to-import JSON workflows, it contains:

### 📹 Video demos & walkthroughs

### 🖼 Workflow screenshots and diagrams

### 🧩 Use-case case studies and results

### 📄 Architecture decisions and notes

The goal is to showcase automation logic and real-world workflow design while keeping implementation details private.



# 🎯 What You'll Find

. WhatsApp & customer-support agents

. AI Grading System for Education Sector

. E-commerce order & inventory automations

. OCR / PDF extraction pipelines

. Google Sheets & API integration examples

. AI decision flows and logic maps

. Business case studies and before/after metrics


# 🔒 Guardrails & Safety

. Each visual case study includes notes on guardrails applied inside workflows:

. Input validation and sanitization

. Restricted system prompts and minimized LLM context

. Rate limiting and retry/backoff strategies

. Approval steps for sensitive actions

. Environment-based API key handling

. Measures to reduce hallucination and unsafe outputs


# 📊 Observability & Monitoring

.  Logging points & structured execution logs

.  Error branches with alerting (email / WhatsApp / Discord)

.  Execution reports and run-history checks

.  Fail-safe fallbacks and human handoff triggers





### Note: This repo is intentionally non-distributable for production flows. Visual materials are shared for learning, portfolio, and client pitching while protecting implementation details.




# 🧭 How to Use This Repo

. Browse folders for domain-specific case studies (e.g., ecommerce, education).

. Watch video demos to understand flow logic and handoffs.

. Read architecture notes for observability & guardrails.

. Contact Samia for custom builds or consultancy.
