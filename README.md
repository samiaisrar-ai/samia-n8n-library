# samia-n8n-library
This repository showcases n8n-based AI agents and automations designed by Samia Israr.
Instead of providing ready-to-import JSON workflows, it contains:

### 📹 Video demos & walkthroughs

### 🖼 Workflow screenshots and diagrams

### 🧩 Use-case case studies and results

### 📄 Architecture decisions and notes

The goal is to showcase automation logic and real-world workflow design while keeping implementation details private.


# 🎯 What You'll Find

. WhatsApp & customer-support agents

. AI Grading System for Education Sector

. E-commerce order & inventory automations

# 🔒 Guardrails & Safety

. Each visual case study includes notes on guardrails applied inside workflows:

. Rate limiting and retry/backoff strategies

. Approval steps for sensitive actions

. Environment-based API key handling

. Measures to reduce hallucination and unsafe outputs

### Note: This repo is intentionally non-distributable for production flows. Visual materials are shared for learning, portfolio, and client pitching while protecting implementation details.
