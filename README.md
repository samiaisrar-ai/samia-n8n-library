# samia-n8n-library
This repository showcases n8n-based AI agents and automations designed by Samia Israr.
Instead of providing ready-to-import JSON workflows, it contains:

📹 Video demos & walkthroughs

🖼 Workflow screenshots and diagrams

🧩 Use-case case studies and results

📄 Architecture decisions and notes

The goal is to showcase automation logic and real-world workflow design while keeping implementation details private.
